# Async Write Atoms

In Async write atoms the \`write\` function of atom returns a promise.

~~~js
const counter = atom(0);
const asyncAtom = atom(null, async (set, get) => {
    // await something
    set(counter, get(counter) + 1);
});
~~~

**Note**: An important take here is that async write function does not trigger the Suspense.

But an interesting pattern that can be achieved with Jotai is switching from async to sync to trigger suspending when wanted.

~~~js
const request = async () => fetch('https://...').then((res) => res.json())
const baseAtom = atom(0)
const Component = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = useAtom(baseAtom)
  const handleClick = () => {
    setValue(request()) // Will suspend until request resolves
  }
  // ...
}
~~~
`;
